#summary Basic issues that need to be resolved.

= Installation =

Need to figure out to reliably install the driver, attach it to devices and make the service start.

I have a couple of tools to help (console.exe, wdffltrinstall.exe, busdog.inf).

At the moment the filter is installed as a lower filter for USB and HID classes via the inf

= busdog usercode reporting =

Currently I have a IOCTL that user code can grab the trace buffer from but the (virtual) machine is severely slowed down when I trace a high volume bulk usb device.

Some ideas to combat this problem:

 - try not to allocate and deallocate trace items all the time (use a ring buffer of trace items and just reallocate if an item needs more space)

 - currently the trace list is synchronized by a WDFWAITLOCK which might be causing troubles from excessive context switching or something maybe I could use a WDFQUEUE (WdfIoQueueCreate etc) apparently they have fast locking mechanisms

==Update==

Turns out the culprit was just logging was flooding the system (free builds run fine)

= Adjustable debug logging levels =

Probably add another ioctl for this...
